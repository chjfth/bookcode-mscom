If you have troubles getting the samples to build and run, try some
of the following troubleshooting steps:
<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Consult the README file in each sample directory to review
    steps on how to build and run sample.
<LI>Consult the README file in each sample to verify if you have
    the proper software installed (i.e. DCOM for Windows 95,
    Service Packs, Platform SDK, etc.).
    See <A HREF="cdwhat.htm">What's on CD</A> and
    <A HREF="software.htm">Software and Cool Links</A>
    for more information.
<LI>If a sample requires the Platform SDK, be sure that the path to
    the SDK files is listed before the other compiler paths in
    Visual C++ 5.0. To check this out, in Visual C++, choose 
    Tools/Options and click the Directories tab. For a default
    install of the Platform SDK, the following paths should be
    listed first in Executable Files, Include Files, and Library
    Files:<BR>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>
        C:\MSSDK\bin<BR>
        C:\MSSDK\include<BR>
        C:\MSSDK\lib<BR>
        </BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>Make sure you have the proper EXEs and DLLs registered.
    You typically register an EXE by running the EXE.
    You typically register a DLL by using the REGSVR32.EXE utility
    and using the following syntax:<BR>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>REGSVR32 Component.dll</BLOCKQUOTE>
    You can also register a DLL within Visual C++ 5.0 by making it
    the active project and choosing Tools/Register Control.
<LI>Registry entries from the configuration of previous samples may
    conflict with the current sample being tested. If you suspect
    that this is the case you can delete these entries from the
    registry using the Registry Editor (REGEDIT.EXE).
    Remember, it is always a good idea to back up your Registery
    before you make changes to it.    
    The Inside DCOM samples typically have a subkey with the
    following format:<BR>
        <BLOCKQUOTE>{1?000???-0000-0000-0000-0000000000??}</BLOCKQUOTE>
    Some sample keys entered into the registry by the Inside
    DCOM samples are shown here:<BR>
	<BLOCKQUOTE>
        HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\AppID\{10000002-0000-0000-0000-000000000001}<BR>
        HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{10000002-0000-0000-0000-000000000001}<BR>
        HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Component.InsideDCOM<BR>
        HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Component.Prime<BR>
        HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Interface\{10000001-0000-0000-0000-000000000001}<BR>
        HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{10000003-0000-0000-0000-000000000001}
	</BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>If you have an HRESULT error value, use the HRESULT Error
    Utility or WINERROR.H to determine what the error value means.
    The HRESULT Error Utility source files are located in the
    HRESULT directory on this CD.  WINERROR.H is installed with
    Visual C++ and by default is located in the directory
    C:\Program Files\DevStudio\VC\include
<LI>If you are testing a sample that runs remotely, be sure that it
    will run properly locally first.
<LI>If you are testing a sample that runs remotely, you may need to
    adjust Location, Security, Identity settings with the DCOM
    Configuration Utility (DCOMCNFG.EXE).
<LI>If you are testing a sample that runs remotely, be aware that
    Windows 95/98 does not support remote instantiation, so the
    remote computer may need to running Windows NT 4.0 or higher.
<LI>When the README instructions say to use the DCOM Configuration
    utility to specify that the sample should run on a remote
    computer, you should follow these steps:
    <UL>
        <LI>Run DCOMCNFG.EXE
        <LI>Double click the registered executable component
            (for most samples, it is "Inside DCOM Sample")
        <LI>Click the Location tab
        <LI>Make sure the Run Application On This Computer checkbox
            is unchecked
        <LI>Check Run Application On The Following Computer
        <LI>Type the computer name in the text box and click OK
	</UL>
<LI>If you suspect security is an issue when testing a remote
    sample, use the DCOM Configuration utility to specify full
    access for Everyone for the component. Once you get the
    component running, then you can specify proper access
    permissions.
<LI>When testing a remote sample, use the Windows NT Task Manager
    to terminate possible component processes still running from a
    previous sample.
<LI>If possible, try testing using Windows NT or on another
    computer.
