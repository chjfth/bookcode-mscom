The SAMPLES directory on this CD contains C++, Visual Basic, and
Java samples that demonstrate all of the topics discussed in the
book.  The samples are arranged by topic rather than by chapter.
Within the main topic directory is a README.TXT file that contains
brief instructions on how to build and run the samples.

<B>Configuration</B><BR>
Various code samples will have different requirements as specified
in the main topic README file. Many of the code samples only
require the following configuration:
<UL>
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 with DCOM installed or
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0
</UL><BR>
The configuration that the code samples were primarily tested on
is as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Microsoft Windows 95 with DCOM installed or
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3)
<LI>Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 Professional SP3 (typical install)
<LI>Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 Professional SP3 (typical install)
<LI>Microsoft Visual J++ 1.1 (typical install)
<LI>Microsoft Windows Platform SDK (January 1998)
</UL><BR>
Some code samples also require the following:
<UL>
<LI>Microsoft Transaction Server 1.0/2.0
<LI>Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 (available on this CD)
<LI>Windows NT 5.0 beta 1 or later
<LI>Microsoft SDK for Java version 2.01 (available on this CD)
<LI>Microsoft virtual machine for Java (available on this CD)
<LI>Microsoft Word
</UL>

<B>Building the C++ and Java Samples</B><BR>
All of the C++ projects and Java projects have been set up as
workspaces to be used with Visual Studio.  You typically open the
.DSW file and build the appropriate projects.  When you build the
Component projects, the MIDL compiler is automatically called, so
it is not necessary to run the MIDL compiler separately.  Also,
many of the projects contain dependencies.  For example, if you
build the Client project, which is dependent upon files generated
by the Component build, the Component project is automatically
built first and then the Client project is built.
