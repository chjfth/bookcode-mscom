The "include" directory contains several helper classes.

The "Hello" directory contains the minimum (error checking and resource reclamation are ignored) source code required for building distributed components using COM.  Appendix D explains the code within this directory.

The "FixAutomationMarshaler.reg" file contains the required registry entries for the 32-bit automation marshaler, which are incorrectly removed by ATL.  The details of this problem is discussed in KB Article ID: Q185599 (BUG: OleAut32.dll Is Unregistered Incorrectly).

All projects are built using Visual C++ 6.0.
